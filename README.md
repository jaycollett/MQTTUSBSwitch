MQTT Enabled USB Switch to remotely connect/disconnect USB devices. This firmware and hardware attempts to mimic the actual pin connect/disconnect sequence that occurs when physically inserting or removing a USB plug. The board uses USB 3.0 connectors but only supports USB 2.0. Future versions will correctly switch the extra SS data pins so it will support USB 3.0.
